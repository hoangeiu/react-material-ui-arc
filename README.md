# Introduce

The React Material-UI Arc combines ReactJS and Material-UI to build an economic website. Because use of Material-UI, I concentrate on creating an attractive interface that consists of much useful information for customers. The website provides information about many technical services that customers can order to build their website. Besides that, I implemented an estimated page that can give estimated price to the customer and a contact page that helps the customer gets more information.

The project is base on ***Implement High Fidelity Designs with Material-UI and ReactJS*** an Udemy Course.
